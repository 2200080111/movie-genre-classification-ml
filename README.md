## 📚 Project Description

The objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the **genre** of a movie by analyzing its **plot description**.  
The project involves:
- Preprocessing raw text data
- Converting text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
- Training multiple classifiers
- Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🗂 Dataset

- `train_data.txt` — Training data containing movie ID, title, genre, and description
- `test_data.txt` — Testing data containing movie ID, title, and description
- `test_data_solution.txt` — Ground truth labels (genre) for the test set

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK (for text preprocessing)
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score (per genre)
